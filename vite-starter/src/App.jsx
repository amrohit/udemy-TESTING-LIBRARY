/**
 * "Test Files 1 Passed" means that one test file has been executed and all the tests within that file have passed.
 * "Tests 4 Passed" means that four individual tests have passed. These tests could be spread across multiple test files or could all be in the same file.
 * For example, you might have a single test file with four tests in it. If all four tests pass, you would see both "Test Files 1 Passed" (because one file has been successfully tested) and "Tests 4 Passed" (because four individual tests have passed).
